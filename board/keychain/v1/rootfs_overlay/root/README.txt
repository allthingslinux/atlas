All Things Linux Abridged System // Tux Keychain
================================================
-- IMPORTANT INFORMATION DO NOT SKIP THIS --
If you experience issues with lots of text blinking, this is an issue with 'minicom'.
We personally use 'tio' instead.

ALL CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THIS SYSTEM WILL BE LOST ON REBOOT.
You can use the '/root/persistent' directory to store files that will persist across reboots.
Keep in mind that this is limited to 1MB, and writing way too often will wear out the flash memory.
You can purchase/build the 'Tux Keychain Expansion Board' to get access to stuff like a microSD card slot.

The '/root/persistent' directory will be reset upon flashing a new firmware.
You can use it as a flash drive though to backup files before flashing.
-- END OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION --


Thank you for purchasing or building a Tux Keychain!
